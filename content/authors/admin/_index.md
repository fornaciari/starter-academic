I am a forensic psychologist of the Italian National Police.
I carried out criminal analysis for cases of homicide.

During the PhD, I applied NLP methods for deception detection.
Afterwards I dealt with technological innovation for Open Source INTelligence at the Ministry of Interior.

Since 2018 I am on leave as attending a postdoc at the Bocconi Univeristy, where I apply Deep Learning methods for social sciences.
